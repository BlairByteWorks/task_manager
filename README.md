# task_manager

Project Overview

A modular task management application built using JavaScript ES6 modules, classes, and object-oriented programming principles. The application demonstrates modern web development practices with a clean, colorful user interface.

Features

•	Add, complete and delete tasks

•	Colorful gradient design with smooth animations

•	Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)

•	Real-time task statistics

•	In-memory data persistence during session

•	Responsive design for all devices


Technologies Used

•	HTML5 - Semantic markup structure

•	CSS3 - Modern styling with gradients, transitions, and animations

•	JavaScript ES6+ - Classes, modules, and modern syntax

•	Docker - Containerization for easy deployment

•	Nginx - Web server for production hosting


Technical Implementation

Object-Oriented Design

Task class with methods for toggling completion status
Separation of concerns with dedicated modules:

•	Task.js - Task class definition

•	store.js - Data persistence layer

•	view.js - DOM rendering and UI updates

•	utils.js - Helper functions

•	app.js - Main application logic


Key Concepts Demonstrated

•	ES6 Classes and constructors

•	Module imports/exports

•	Event delegation

•	State management

•	DOM manipulation

•	Functional programming patterns
